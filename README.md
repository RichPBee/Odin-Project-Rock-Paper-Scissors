# Odin-Project-Rock-Paper-Scissors
Creating the rock paper scissors game for TOP

-The goal of this project is ultimately create a "Rock, Paper, Scissors" game
with a GUI. 

The first level will simply be a console variant of the game. Using a blank 
HTML page to reference a JS script and run in the browser console. 
This will aim to take a user input and generate a random response from the computer,
before testing these against one another and determining the result to be displayed. 

The second level will involve developing the GUI for the game.
This is not the aim of the project at this stage, and will be described in more depth
at a later date.

Section 2: 

Here the aim is to build a GUI for the rock-paper-scissors game. I will start by wire-
framing the desired game screen, before adding styles and text as desired. 
following this, the game logic will be refactored to include DOM methods and to allow
for a brief intro screen.
